IBKR will send all non data message through error channel, hence we need to carefully check the error code to decide if it is an actual error or notã€‚

### Architectural Refactor: "Queue as Interface" for Inter-Service Communication

**Problem:** There was a design mismatch between the `IBKRBridge` (which used a direct callback to "push" news) and the `NewsHandler` (which was designed to "pull" news from a queue). This created a tight coupling and an inconsistent data flow.

**Solution:** Refactored the entire application to use a consistent, event-driven "Queue as Interface" pattern for all communication between services. This aligns with the core design principles.

**Implementation:**
1.  **`IBKRBridge` as Producer:** The bridge no longer uses a direct callback. It now acts as a simple producer, placing the raw news data dictionary onto a dedicated `raw_news_queue`.
2.  **`NewsHandler` as Consumer:** The handler was refactored to consume from the `raw_news_queue`, process the data, and place the results onto a `processed_news_queue` for the next service in the pipeline.
3.  **`main.py` as Orchestrator:** The main application entry point was overhauled to create and connect these queues, wiring all the services together. The startup and shutdown logic was also modernized and made more robust.

**Benefit:** This architecture is now fully non-blocking, truly decoupled, and provides a clear, scalable data pipeline for handling high-frequency events.
