# Development Progress for "Momentum API" Trading Bot

## Current Status: Initial Core Module Implementation Complete

### Summary of Work Completed:

*   **Project Scaffolding:**
    *   Created the project directory structure as specified in `tss.md`:
        *   `momentum_api_bot/config/`
        *   `momentum_api_bot/data/`
        *   `momentum_api_bot/logs/`
        *   `momentum_api_bot/momentum_bot/` (with `__init__.py`)
        *   `momentum_api_bot/momentum_bot/services/` (with `__init__.py`)
        *   `momentum_api_bot/momentum_bot/ibkr_bridge/` (with `__init__.py`, `bridge.py`, `wrapper.py`, `client.py`)
    *   Created placeholder files for `config.yaml`, `main.py`, `news_handler.py`, `detection_engine.py`, `execution_service.py`, `position_manager.py`, `models.py`, and `utils.py`.
    *   Removed `ibkr_connector.py`.

*   **Core Module Implementation (Initial Versions):**
    *   **`IBKRBridge` (`momentum_bot/ibkr_bridge/`):** Implemented the foundational connection logic to the Interactive Brokers API using the official `ibapi` library. This module manages a dedicated synchronous API thread, handles connection status, and uses thread-safe queues to bridge communication between the `ibapi` callbacks and the main `asyncio` event loop. It includes `IBWrapper` (inheriting `EWrapper`) and `IBClient` (inheriting `EClient`) for direct `ibapi` interaction.
    *   **`models.py` (`momentum_bot/models.py`):** Defined `TradeSignal` and `Position` dataclasses to represent data flowing through the system.
    *   **`NewsHandler` (`momentum_bot/services/news_handler.py`):** Implemented as a consumer of news articles from the `IBKRBridge`'s incoming queue. It parses XML content to extract tickers and puts them into a processed news queue for further analysis.
    *   **`DetectionEngine` (`momentum_bot/services/detection_engine.py`):** Implemented as a consumer worker pool. It processes tickers from the news queue, requests historical and real-time market data via `IBKRBridge`, applies the "Shock Detection Algorithm," and creates `TradeSignal` objects.
    *   **`ExecutionService` (`momentum_bot/services/execution_service.py`):** Handles `TradeSignal` objects, applies gating logic (checking `IBKRBridge` connection status), places market orders via `IBKRBridge`, and records open positions.
    *   **`PositionManager` (`momentum_bot/services/position_manager.py`):** Monitors open positions, requests real-time market data via `IBKRBridge` for P&L calculation, applies exit conditions (Take Profit, Stop Loss), and triggers position closures via the `ExecutionService`.

*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   Updated `pyproject.toml` to include `ibapi` and add `numpy`, `PyYAML`, and `SQLAlchemy`. `uvloop` was removed due to Windows incompatibility.
    *   Successfully installed all project dependencies using `uv pip install -e .`.

*   **Application Orchestration:**
    *   **`main.py` (`momentum_bot/main.py`):** Implemented the application entry point, responsible for loading configuration (from `config/config.yaml`), initializing and starting all core services, managing `asyncio.Queue` instances for inter-module communication, and handling graceful shutdown. It also includes an `orchestrator_task` to bridge messages from the `IBKRBridge`'s synchronous queue to the asynchronous event loop.

### Recent Progress:

*   **Rewritten IBKR Connectivity:**
    *   Completely replaced `ib_insync` with the official `ibapi` library for all Interactive Brokers API interactions.
    *   Introduced `IBKRBridge` module (`momentum_bot/ibkr_bridge/`) to manage the synchronous `ibapi` client in a separate thread and facilitate communication with the `asyncio` main loop via thread-safe queues.
    *   Removed the `ibkr_connector.py` file.
*   **Refined `NewsHandler` and `utils.py`:**
    *   Implemented `parse_ibkr_news_xml` function in `momentum_bot/utils.py` to extract ticker symbols from IBKR news XML content.
    *   Updated `NewsHandler` to consume processed news articles from the `IBKRBridge`'s incoming queue via the main orchestrator.
*   **Enhanced `DetectionEngine`:**
    *   Updated the `_worker` method in `momentum_bot/services/detection_engine.py` to include a more detailed placeholder for the "Shock Detection Algorithm."
    *   This now requests historical data and real-time market data snapshots via `IBKRBridge`, calculates simplified ATR and SMA for volume, and applies the Price Shock and Volume Shock conditions as defined in the PRD.
*   **Implemented `Position Sizing Algorithm`:**
    *   Updated the `_worker` method in `momentum_bot/services/execution_service.py` to implement the Position Sizing Algorithm based on the formula provided in the PRD.
    *   Includes placeholder `account_value` and `risk_per_trade_percent`, and assumes a `stop_loss_price` for calculation.
*   **Integrated SQLite for Trade Records:**
    *   Created `momentum_bot/database.py` with SQLAlchemy models for `Trade` and `PositionRecord` and an `init_db` function.
    *   Modified `ExecutionService` to store new `PositionRecord`s and `Trade` records in the SQLite database upon order fill.
    *   Modified `PositionManager` to load existing `PositionRecord`s from the database at startup and update their status, as well as the corresponding `Trade` record's status, `exit_price`, `exit_timestamp`, and `pnl` when positions are closed.
    *   Updated `main.py` to initialize the database and pass the SQLAlchemy `Session` factory to `ExecutionService` and `PositionManager`.
*   **Refined `DetectionEngine` Market Data and Technical Indicators:**
    *   Implemented `calculate_atr` and `calculate_sma` functions in `momentum_bot/utils.py` for accurate technical indicator calculations.
    *   Updated `DetectionEngine` to use `IBKRBridge` to request historical data and then apply the `calculate_atr` and `calculate_sma` functions for the Shock Detection Algorithm.
*   **Implemented Real-time Market Data Streaming in `DetectionEngine`:**
    *   Modified `DetectionEngine._worker` to use `IBKRBridge` to request real-time market data snapshots for the current minute bar, enhancing the accuracy of shock detection.
*   **Refined `PositionManager` P&L Calculation:**
    *   Modified `PositionManager._monitor_positions` to use `IBKRBridge` to request real-time market data snapshots for open positions, enabling more accurate P&L calculation.
*   **Resolved `ModuleNotFoundError`:**
    *   Added `sys.path` modification in `momentum_bot/main.py` to ensure the `momentum_bot` package is discoverable.
*   **Resolved `sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError`:**
    *   Corrected the database URL to use an absolute path in `momentum_bot/main.py`.

*   **`IBKRBridge` Code Review:**
    *   Conducted a detailed review of the `ibkr_bridge` module, including `bridge.py`, `client.py`, and `wrapper.py`.
    *   The review confirms that the implementation correctly establishes a threaded, queue-based communication layer between the main `asyncio` application and the synchronous `ibapi` library, as per the architectural design.
