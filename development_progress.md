# Development Progress for "Momentum API" Trading Bot

## Current Status: Initial Core Module Implementation Complete

### Summary of Work Completed:

*   **Project Scaffolding:**
    *   Created the project directory structure as specified in `tss.md`:
        *   `momentum_api_bot/config/`
        *   `momentum_api_bot/data/`
        *   `momentum_api_bot/logs/`
        *   `momentum_api_bot/momentum_bot/` (with `__init__.py`)
        *   `momentum_api_bot/momentum_bot/services/` (with `__init__.py`)
    *   Created placeholder files for `config.yaml`, `main.py`, `ibkr_connector.py`, `news_handler.py`, `detection_engine.py`, `execution_service.py`, `position_manager.py`, `models.py`, and `utils.py`.

*   **Core Module Implementation (Initial Versions):**
    *   **`IBKRConnector` (`momentum_bot/ibkr_connector.py`):** Implemented the foundational connection logic to the Interactive Brokers API using `ib_insync`, including a state machine (`DISCONNECTED`, `CONNECTING`, `OPERATIONAL`), automatic reconnection with exponential backoff, and event handling for connection status. Placeholder methods for API interactions (news, candles, orders) are included.
    *   **`models.py` (`momentum_bot/models.py`):** Defined `TradeSignal` and `Position` dataclasses to represent data flowing through the system.
    *   **`NewsHandler` (`momentum_bot/services/news_handler.py`):** Implemented the producer module responsible for listening to `ib_insync`'s `newsArticleEvent`. Contains placeholder logic for XML parsing to extract tickers.
    *   **`DetectionEngine` (`momentum_bot/services/detection_engine.py`):** Implemented as a consumer worker pool. It processes tickers from the news queue, simulates market data fetching and the "Shock Detection Algorithm," and creates placeholder `TradeSignal` objects.
    *   **`ExecutionService` (`momentum_bot/services/execution_service.py`):** Handles `TradeSignal` objects, applies gating logic (checking IBKR connection status), simulates position sizing and market order placement via `IBKRConnector`, and records mock open positions.
    *   **`PositionManager` (`momentum_bot/services/position_manager.py`):** Monitors open positions, simulates real-time P&L calculation and applies placeholder exit conditions (Take Profit, Stop Loss), triggering simulated position closures via the `ExecutionService`.

*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   Updated `pyproject.toml` to replace `ibapi` with `ib_insync` and add `numpy`, `PyYAML`, and `SQLAlchemy`. `uvloop` was removed due to Windows incompatibility.
    *   Successfully installed all project dependencies using `uv pip install -e .`.

*   **Application Orchestration:**
    *   **`main.py` (`momentum_bot/main.py`):** Implemented the application entry point, responsible for loading configuration (from `config/config.yaml`), initializing and starting all core services, managing `asyncio.Queue` instances for inter-module communication, and handling graceful shutdown.

### Recent Progress:

*   **Refined `NewsHandler` and `utils.py`:**
    *   Implemented `parse_ibkr_news_xml` function in `momentum_bot/utils.py` to extract ticker symbols from IBKR news XML content.
    *   Updated `NewsHandler` to utilize `parse_ibkr_news_xml` for processing incoming news articles.
*   **Enhanced `DetectionEngine`:**
    *   Updated the `_worker` method in `momentum_bot/services/detection_engine.py` to include a more detailed placeholder for the "Shock Detection Algorithm."
    *   This now simulates fetching historical data, calculating simplified ATR and SMA for volume, and applying the Price Shock and Volume Shock conditions as defined in the PRD.
*   **Implemented `Position Sizing Algorithm`:**
    *   Updated the `_worker` method in `momentum_bot/services/execution_service.py` to implement the Position Sizing Algorithm based on the formula provided in the PRD.
    *   Includes placeholder `account_value` and `risk_per_trade_percent`, and assumes a `stop_loss_price` for calculation.
*   **Integrated SQLite for Trade Records:**
    *   Created `momentum_bot/database.py` with SQLAlchemy models for `Trade` and `PositionRecord` and an `init_db` function.
    *   Modified `ExecutionService` to store new `PositionRecord`s and `Trade` records in the SQLite database upon order fill.
    *   Modified `PositionManager` to load existing `PositionRecord`s from the database at startup and update their status, as well as the corresponding `Trade` record's status, `exit_price`, `exit_timestamp`, and `pnl` when positions are closed.
    *   Updated `main.py` to initialize the database and pass the SQLAlchemy `Session` factory to `ExecutionService` and `PositionManager`.
*   **Refined `IBKRConnector` API Calls:**
    *   Replaced placeholder API calls in `momentum_bot/ibkr_connector.py` with actual `ib_insync` methods for `subscribe_to_news` (using `reqMktData` for news headlines), `fetch_candles` (using `reqHistoricalDataAsync`), `stream_quotes` (using `reqMktDataAsync`), and `place_order` (using `placeOrderAsync`).
*   **Refined `DetectionEngine` Market Data and Technical Indicators:**
    *   Implemented `calculate_atr` and `calculate_sma` functions in `momentum_bot/utils.py` for accurate technical indicator calculations.
    *   Updated `DetectionEngine` to use `ibkr_connector.fetch_candles` to fetch historical data and then apply the `calculate_atr` and `calculate_sma` functions for the Shock Detection Algorithm.
*   **Implemented Real-time Market Data Streaming in `DetectionEngine`:**
    *   Modified `DetectionEngine._worker` to use `ibkr_connector.stream_quotes` to get real-time price and volume for the current minute bar, enhancing the accuracy of shock detection.
*   **Refined `PositionManager` P&L Calculation:**
    *   Modified `PositionManager._monitor_positions` to use `ibkr_connector.stream_quotes` to fetch real-time market data for open positions, enabling more accurate P&L calculation.
*   **Resolved `ModuleNotFoundError`:**
    *   Added `sys.path` modification in `momentum_bot/main.py` to ensure the `momentum_bot` package is discoverable.
*   **Resolved `sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError`:**
    *   Corrected the database URL to use an absolute path in `momentum_bot/main.py`.
*   **Resolved `AttributeError` in `NewsHandler`:**
    *   Correctly subscribed to `ib.tickNewsEvent` and implemented fetching of news articles using `reqNewsArticleAsync` in `momentum_bot/services/news_handler.py`.
*   **Resolved `AttributeError` in `IBKRConnector` (`placeOrderAsync`):**
    *   Changed `placeOrderAsync` to `placeOrder` in `momentum_bot/ibkr_connector.py`.
*   **Resolved `AttributeError` in `IBKRConnector` (`tickerByContract` and `Ticker` not awaitable):**
    *   Correctly handled `ib.reqMktData` and `ib.tickerByContract` after qualifying the contract in `momentum_bot/ibkr_connector.py`.

### Next Steps:

*   **Testing and Validation:** Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests for all modules.
*   **Configuration Management:** Externalize all configurable parameters (e.g., IBKR connection details, strategy parameters, risk settings) into `config/config.yaml` and ensure they are properly loaded and utilized.
*   **Error Handling and Robustness:** Enhance error handling, logging, and edge-case management across all modules for increased system robustness.
