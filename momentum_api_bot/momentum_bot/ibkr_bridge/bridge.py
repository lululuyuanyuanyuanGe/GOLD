"""
Contains the IBKRBridge class, the central orchestrator for all communication
with the Interactive Brokers API.

This class is responsible for:
1.  Managing the dedicated thread for the synchronous official 'ibapi'.
2.  Instantiating and connecting the IBClient and IBWrapper.
3.  Managing the thread-safe queues for sending and receiving messages.
4.  Providing a high-level, asynchronous interface for the rest of the application.
5.  Managing the request/response lifecycle using unique IDs and asyncio.Future objects.
6.  Handling the connection state machine (Disconnected, Connecting, Operational).
7.  Managing the generation of unique, thread-safe order IDs and request IDs.
