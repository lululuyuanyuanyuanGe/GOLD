### **Product Requirements Document: "Momentum API" Real-Time News Trading Bot**

### **1. Introduction & Vision**

**1.1. The Problem:** Financial markets price in new information with extreme velocity. Manually trading on breaking news is impossible due to the speed required to ingest, analyze, and act. An automated solution is required to systematically capture the initial price movement driven by significant news events.

**1.2. The Vision:** To create a high-speed, automated trading system that connects directly to a low-latency news feed via the Interactive Brokers (IBKR) API. The system will programmatically identify news tied to a specific stock, detect the market's initial reaction, execute a trade in the direction of the momentum, and manage the position based on a strict set of rules.

**1.3. Core Workflow:**
1.  Establish a persistent connection to the IBKR API.
2.  Subscribe to a real-time, machine-readable news feed (e.g., Benzinga) through the API.
3.  Instantly parse incoming structured news data to extract the stock ticker.
4.  Upon receiving a ticker, analyze live market data for a qualifying price/volume "shock."
5.  Execute a market order to enter a position and apply a predefined risk management strategy to exit.

### **2. Strategic Goals & Success Metrics**

**2.1. Goals:**
*   **Automation:** Fully automate the entire trading lifecycle from news event to position close.
*   **Speed:** Minimize end-to-end latency from the moment a news item is published to the moment an order is confirmed by the exchange.
*   **Reliability:** Build a robust system with stable connections and consistent data processing.
*   **Profitability:** Achieve a net positive P&L under the specified trading strategy.

**2.2. Success Metrics:**
*   **Financial Metrics:**
    *   Net P&L (Profit & Loss)
    *   Win/Loss Ratio
    *   Average Profit per Winning Trade vs. Average Loss per Losing Trade
    *   Sharpe Ratio (Risk-Adjusted Return)
*   **Performance Metrics:**
    *   **End-to-End Latency:** Time from the news article's API timestamp to IBKR order confirmation (Target: < 200ms).
    *   **API Message Processing Time:** Time taken by the application to parse a news object and generate a trade signal (Target: < 10ms).
    *   **Slippage:** Average monetary difference between the market price at signal generation and the final execution price.
    *   **System Uptime:** Must be > 99.9% during market hours.

### **3. System Features & User Stories**

**3.1. Module 1: IBKR Gateway Connection**
*   **Description:** The foundational module responsible for connecting to the IBKR Gateway or TWS.
*   **User Story:** As a trader, I need the system to securely and reliably connect to my IBKR account so that it can access data feeds and execute trades.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Securely manage and utilize IBKR API credentials.
    *   Implement robust logic for automatic reconnection in case of connection drops.
    *   Provide a real-time dashboard status of the API connection.

**3.2. Module 2: Real-Time News Ingestion & Parsing**
*   **Description:** This module subscribes to the specified news feed via the IBKR API and processes the incoming structured data.
*   **User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to listen to a high-speed Benzinga news feed via the API and instantly read the ticker symbol from each news item as it arrives.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Correctly subscribe to the designated premium news provider (e.g., Benzinga) available through IBKR.
    *   The parser must be built to handle the exact data structure of the IBKR news API objects, correctly identifying fields for timestamp, headline, and associated tickers.
    *   Efficiently filter out news items that do not contain a stock ticker.
    *   The module must be non-blocking and capable of handling a high-velocity stream of news without creating a backlog.

**3.3. Module 3: Event Detection & Qualification Engine**
*   **Description:** The core logic engine that receives a ticker and determines if a tradeable event is occurring.
*   **User Story:** As a trader, once the system gets a ticker from a news alert, I want it to immediately check the stockâ€™s live price and volume to confirm a significant surge is happening before it decides to trade.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Upon receiving a valid ticker, the system must issue a high-priority request for real-time market data (Level 1 quotes) from IBKR.
    *   A configurable "Shock Detection Algorithm" will qualify a tradeable event based on thresholds for price change (%) and volume increase (%) relative to a recent baseline.
    *   Determine the direction of the trade (Long/Short) from the price movement.
    *   Generate an immutable trade signal (e.g., Ticker, Direction, Signal Price, Timestamp) for the execution module.

**3.4. Module 4: Trade Execution & Position Sizing**
*   **Description:** This module is responsible for placing orders based on signals from the qualification engine.
*   **User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to instantly place an order with a calculated share size as soon as the qualification engine confirms a valid trade signal.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   **Order Type:** Must use **Market Orders** to ensure the fastest possible entry.
    *   **Position Sizing Algorithm:** Trade size must be calculated based on a configurable model (e.g., fixed risk-per-trade, fixed dollar amount).
    *   The module must confirm the order was accepted by IBKR and log the execution details (fill price, quantity, timestamp).

**3.5. Module 5: Position & Risk Management**
*   **Description:** Once a position is open, this module actively manages it until exit.
*   **User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to watch my open position second-by-second and automatically sell it to lock in my target profit or cut my losses according to my plan.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Subscribe to real-time market data for the open position to track P&L.
    *   **Bracket Order Logic:** Implement exit rules using a predefined Take-Profit target (e.g., +2.0%) and a hard Stop-Loss (e.g., -1.5%).
    *   **Time-Based Stop:** Include a non-negotiable "max time in trade" exit (e.g., 10 minutes) as a fail-safe.

### **4. Assumptions, Risks, and Open Questions**

**4.1. Assumptions:**
*   A subscription to a premium, low-latency news provider (like Benzinga Pro for API) via IBKR is active.
*   The news feed provides clean, machine-readable data, including correctly formatted stock tickers for relevant news.
*   The IBKR API and the user's network infrastructure are fast enough to execute the strategy.

**4.2. CRITICAL RISKS:**
*   **Risk 1: Latency Disadvantage (HIGH):** While this API-based approach is fast, it competes with institutional firms co-located with exchange data centers. The inherent latency of a retail internet connection could still result in entering trades after the initial price move has occurred, leading to suboptimal entry prices.
*   **Risk 2: Execution Risk (HIGH):** The strategy specifically targets high-volatility moments. This exposes all market orders to significant **slippage** and **wide bid-ask spreads**, which can severely impact profitability.
*   **Risk 3: API & Data Risk (MEDIUM):** The system is entirely dependent on the uptime and data quality of the IBKR API and the Benzinga news feed. Any downtime, data corruption, or change in the API format could halt operations or cause erroneous trades.

**4.3. Open Questions / Undefined Algorithms:**
*   What is the exact cost and message-per-second limit of the required IBKR news subscription?
*   What is the precise data schema of the news objects from the API? (Requires developer investigation).
*   What are the specific mathematical formulas and parameters for the "Shock Detection" and "Position Sizing" algorithms?
*   What is the plan for backtesting this strategy? Simulating execution during high-volatility news events is non-trivial.
